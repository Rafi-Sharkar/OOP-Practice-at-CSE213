//Introduction of Object Oriented Programming
As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

OOPs Concepts:
1. Class
2. Objects
3. Data Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
7. Dynamic Binding
8. Message Passing

What is DRY?
-> DRY stands for - Do not Repeat Yourself.

Class___
-> A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

    form  -- filled by a parson   -- form of that person
    class -- object instantiation -- object

Object___
-> An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

Noun    --> Class   --> Employee
Adjective   --> Attribute   --> name, age, salary, experience,etc.
Verb    --> Methods     --> getSalary(), inCrement(), etc.
